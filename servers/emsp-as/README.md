# e-Mobility Service Provider Autorization Server

This is the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server implementation for the e-Mobility Service Provider (eMSP).

The software is written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and implements a web service which utilizes the [Authlete Authorization Server API](https://docs.authlete.com/en/shared/latest) as described [here](https://www.authlete.com/developers/overview/).
It is developed with no focus on implementation security.
**Do not use it in production environments!**
